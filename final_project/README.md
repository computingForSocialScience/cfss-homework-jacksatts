This project is definitely a doozy. 
Should everything had gone smoothly, the goal was to paint a picture of the situation of 
minorities and second language learners. The tables we drew data on were:

B01001. Sex by Age
B02001. Race
B16010. Educational Attainment and Employment Status by Language Spoken At Home for the Population 25 Years and Over 
B16009. Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months by Age by Language Spoken At Home for the Population 5+ Yrs 
B16008. Citizenship Status by Age by Language Spoken At Home for the Population 5+ Yrs 
B99163. Imputation of Ability to Speak English for the Population 5 Years and Over
